# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about...
- Part A:
  - Return true if each element of wordList contains the previous element as a substring
  - Return false if not
- Part B:
  - Return an ArrayList of String based on strings from the wordList that contains target
  - Each element of the returned ArrayList has the target removed, contains the leftovers.

## Struggles with this question...
- An error about out of bounce

## Prior experiences that helped...

## What I learned by doing this question...
- Follow the code and check if it's out of bounce next time when finishing the code
