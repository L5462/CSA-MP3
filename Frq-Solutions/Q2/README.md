# 2024 Question 2

## This question is about...
- Create a custom class that represents a scoreboard for a sporting event
- Mangaging all of the data, such as team names, scores, and which team is active
- Updating instance variables to keep track of when a team scored
- Creating an output statement to show the current standing of the game

## Struggles with this question...
- None
- This frq is very straight forward, there's no problem solving.

## Prior experiences that helped...
- I did harder create class frqs than this one
- Do more practice frqs

## What I learned by doing this question...
- I learned diffferent ways of doing this question: Two booleans and One int (2 Ways)
  - Two booleans
    - One for team1 and one for team2
  - One int
    - Increasing the int. When mod int is zero, team1 is active. When mod int is not zero, team2 is active.
    - In this case, int would only be zero or one. When it's zero, team1 is active. When it's one, team2 is active.
